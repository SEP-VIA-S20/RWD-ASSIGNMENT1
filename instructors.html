        <h1>Lucas Saldanha</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am Lucas and I have a passion for fitness. I come from Brazil and there is where my education started. I have been working in this field for 5 years now and I have been a VIAFit instructor for 3 years. I have learned to mix the Brazilian training style with the Danish training values, so my classes are never the same. I value the fact that the gym keeps close contact with its members and during my time here I have come to appreciate the importance of the relationship between instructor and member.</p>
        <p>I am always happy to hear form you, so if you have any questions regarding the classes, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:300709@via.dk">contact me</a>.</p>

        <p>Hi everyone, my name is Dimitrian and if you join our gym and my classes you will not be disappointed. I started training with VIAFit 6 years ago and because I appreciated the passion and dedication of the instructors, I became one. My experience was formed in this small gym, so I have a proper knowledge of all the equipment and classes we provide. During my time here I have seen how members shape their desired body through the guidance of the instructors and I believe that everyone can get in shape. </p>

        <h1>Daniel Railean</h1>
        <p>My name is Daniel. I am one of the instructors here. I have a 3 years’ experience in fitness and bodybuilding, and I look forward on seeing you in the class. I teach in most of the classes, but I have a passion for high intensity training. I believe that is more to fitness than just reshaping your body. It’s also coordinating the breathing with the movement in order to build a healthy and strong heart and a better blood circulation. During my classes you will learn how to strengthen your body and change your meal plan for a healthy lifestyle. </p>
